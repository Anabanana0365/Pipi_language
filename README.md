# how to use


- download the `pipi_language.html`-file and the `info.html`-file.
- put both files in a folder in your computers file explorer. name "it pipi_language" if you want.
- open the `pipi_language.html` that are in the folder.
- now you can use it.

**if you dont put the two files in a folder the button named "info" will NOT work.**

so do that your checkist looks like this:


- [x] put the `pipi_language.html`-file in the folder
- [x] put the `info.html-file` in the same folder
- [x] open the `pipi_language.html`-file in the folder
- [ ] open the `pipi_language.html`-file that **not** are in the folder


instead of this!:


- [ ] put the `pipi_language.html`-file in the folder
- [ ] put the `info.html-file` in the same folder
- [ ] open the `pipi_language.html`-file in the folder
- [x] open the `pipi_language.html`-file that **not** are in the folder




## good luck! :)
